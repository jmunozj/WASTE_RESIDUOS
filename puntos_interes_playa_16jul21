The easiest access is through the Paseo de Pereda, Castelar Street and Victoria Avenue; Avenue of the Castros and tunnel Tetuan; Ride and General Dávila. The Camel Beach is considered one of the most representative and emblematic beaches of the city of Santander for its unique topography. Among its features is a rock in the sand that wants to represent a camel and hence comes its name. The Camel is located within the area of Santander, which makes it a city beach, its length is 200 meters and its average width 50 meters and is characterized by golden sand of high quality fine grain with water moderate waves by winds from the Bay of Biscay and a high level of occupancy. It has a bounded area to play palas, typical Cantabrian beach sport . El Sardinero was declared of Cultural Interest in 1986. During the last decades of the nineteenth  Europe developed a taste for sea dips and looking for suitable places to rest and social relationship, open, breezy and mild climate. This fact causes that around Sardinero and privileged coast, a major urban development of high aesthetic level developed. In 1846, the growing number of locals, the City determined to build a road that gave access from the Alta to the beaches of Sardinero. The following year surf baths in Santande appeared advertised in the Gazette of Madrid r. But it is from 1849 when  the development of this areastarts; then the first concessions for inns and hostelries are requested. In 1861, Queen Elizabeth II and her family decide to spend a season in Santander. The dissemination of this visit led to the incorporation of Sardinero to list hotspots-therapeutic-and summer. The Pombo family gets the grant in 1868 to build a bathing beach on the first. Meanwhile  the first Casino and the Grand Hotel (now Hotel Sardinero) were constructed. In 1872, Amadeode Savoya comes to town . In 1873 ten thousand tamarinds were planted the following year, Castañeda spa opened at Second Beach, announcing surprising successes in rheumatism, scrofula, rickets, nervous disorders .... The process is accelerated and many-Zaldivar, Junco, Fons, Luengas ... - open their spas. Later hotels like the Swiss, Castilla, Hoyuela, Paris, Rome and Bandana Square (Piazza Italia) where trams came from Gandarillas and Pombo . With the construction of the Palacio de la Magdalena (1909-1911) and the consolidation of royal summers, many urban improvements are made, to accrue the volume and importance of the new buildings, new buildings such as the Gran Casino del Sardinero. Built on the site of the previous two, the architect who designed it was Eloy Martínez del Valle, much like the Monte-Carlo conducted by Garnier. It was opened in 1916. Shortly after it the Royal Hotel was built in a privileged location, dominating the bay, . It is a magnificent building, designed in 1916 by González de Riancho, five-storey south open porch , and inspired by the grand hotels of Europe with elements taken from  regionalism. These constructs bound, after half a century, the concept of the spa town Sardinero as first order. Finally, some chalets stand as the House of Pardo-Booty-currently, also the work of González Riancho (1915-1918), and the Palace of the Pine, Lavin Casalis (1915).

The easiest access is through the Paseo de Pereda, Castelar Street and Victoria Avenue; Avenue of the Castros and tunnel Tetuan; General Dávila. The Primera del Sardinero is considered one of the most representative beaches and known in Spain, its history linked to the Spanish monarchy and its high interest, as it provides access to beaches as the second beach of el Sardinero, Camello, Concha Magdalena and Bikinis, which gives the city a major beauty Santander. The Primera Playa del Sardinero is located within the area of Santander, which makes it a city beach, its length is 350 meters and its average width 80 meters and is characterized by a fine-grained golden sand high quality with swell waters moderated by winds fromCantabrian Sea and a high level of occupancy. El Sardinero was declared of Cultural Interest in 1986. During the last decades of the nineteenth century it was developed in Europe a taste for sea dips and a desire  for suitable places to rest and to establish social relationships, in an open, breezy and mild climate. This fact made el Sardinero and its privileged coast a major urban development of high aesthetic level. The Pombo family got the grant in 1868 to build a bathing beach while at the same time wereconstructed the first Casino and the Grand Hotel (now Hotel Sardinero). In 1872, Amadeo of Savoy came to town making the Sardinero a summer hotspot. In 1873 ten thousand tamarinds were planted and  the following year Castañeda spa was opened  at the Second Beach, announcing surprising successes in rheumatism, scrofula, rickets, nervous disorders .... The process was accelerated and many-Zaldivar, Junco, Fons, Luengas ... - opened their spas. Later hotels like the Swiss, Castilla, Hoyuela, Paris, Rome were built, and Bandana Square (Piazza Italia) where trams came from Gandarillas and Pombo. With the construction of the Palacio de la Magdalena (1909-1911) and the consolidation of royal summers, many urban improvements were made, to accrue the volume and importance of the new buildings, new buildings such as the Gran Casino del Sardinero. Built on the site of the previous two, the architect who designed it was Eloy Martínez del Valle, much like the Monte-Carlo conducted by Garnier. It was opened in 1916.It has a wide promenade and is provided with the main services for use and enjoyment by visitors like 5 lifeguards and two rooks, two baywatchers (verifiered compliance with legal requirements applicable), a medicalized ambulance, one lifeguard boat, fixed location Rescue and lifesaving, two recycling centers, children's playground, library, play area, showers, foot showers, waste disposal containers, recycling containers three access ramps for the disabled, two footbridges for the disabled, a bugi, three portable toilets and changing rooms and adapted parking accessible for people with reduced mobility, sunbeds and parasols.",
